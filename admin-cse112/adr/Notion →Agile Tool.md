# Context

We need to choose an Agile Tool in order to best keep track of and delegate tasks for the team.

# Decision Summary

We chose Notion due to team familiarity, a nice UI and customizability, as well as the convenience of keeping our documents and SCRUM board in the same place.

# Notion Pros and Cons

## Pros

- Lots of customizability
- Comes with templates, including templates for teams such as the Roadmap
- Combines SCRUM board with our documents in one place.
- Nice visually
- More familiarity

## Cons

- Not used in industry, so less transferability

# GitHub Issues Pros and Cons

## Pros

- Integration with pull requests
- Combines the GitHub repo with issues in the same spot

## Cons

- Not as nice visually
- We want our documents separate from the code

# Conclusion on Notion

We will be using Notion due to it’s ease of use, attractive UI as well as the convenience of having our documents and tasks in one place. 

# Consequences

Because Notion is not commonly used in industry, our experience with Notion will not transfer over to other tools. However, the layout of our Roadmap is very similar to other Agile tools already, such as having tasks to drag into either Not Started, In Progress, Blocked, and Completed, with filters such as by assignee. We will also not have the ability to link pull requests with issues, which is a minor issue for the benefit of having our documents and tasks in one place.
